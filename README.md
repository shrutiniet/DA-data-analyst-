# DA-data-analyst-   Module-1

**Data:** Collection of facts i.e collection of no., pictures,videos, words, measurements, etc. OR Data is a collection of facts that can be used to draw conclusions, make predictions, and assist in decision-making. 
**Data Analysis:** Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.  
**Data Anaylst:** A data analyst is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions. A data analyst is an explorer, a detective, and an artist all rolled into one.
**Data Analytics:** The Science of data.

**People Analytics:** People analytics is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company’s workforce in order to gain insights to improve how the company operates.Being a people analyst involves using data analysis to gain insights about employees and how they experience their work lives. The insights are used to define and create a more productive and empowering workplace. This can unlock employee potential, motivate people to perform at their best, and ensure a fair and inclusive company culture. 
 **The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.**
The analysts organized those tasks and activities around the six phases of the data analysis process: 
1. Ask : The analysts asked questions to define both the issue to be solved and what would equal a successful result. 
2. Prepare: they prepared by building a timeline and collecting data with employee surveys that were designed to be inclusive.
3. Process: They processed the data by cleaning it to make sure it was complete, correct, relevant, and free of errors and outliers.
4. Analyze: They analyzed the clean employee survey data
5. Share: Then the analysts shared their findings and recommendations with team leaders.
6. Act: leadership acted on the results and focused on improving key areas.



 # **Data Ecosystem**
An ecosystem is a group of elements that interact with one another. Ecosystems can be large, like the jungle in a tropical rainforest or the Australian outback. Or, tiny, like tadpoles in a puddle, or bacteria on your skin.
Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them.

Data can also be found in something called the cloud. The cloud is a place to keep data online, rather than on a computer hard drive. So instead of storing data somewhere inside your organization's network, that data is accessed over the internet. So the cloud is just a term we use to describe the virtual location. The cloud plays a big part in the data ecosystem, and as a data analyst, it's your job to harness the power of that data ecosystem, find the right information, and provide the team with analysis that helps them make smart decisions. 

**Data-driven decision-making:** Data-driven decision-making is defined as using facts to guide business strategy. Organizations in many different industries are empowered to make better, data-driven decisions by data analysts all the time.  The first step in data-driven decision-making is figuring out the business need.

# Data and gut instinct
Gut instinct is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right.
**Data + business knowledge = mystery solved**
Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst. The key is figuring out the exact mix for each particular project. A lot of times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis. That is why analysts often ask, “How do I define success for this project?”

# Origins of the data analysis process
The ancient Egyptians were masters of organizing data. They documented their calculations and theories on papyri (paper-like materials), which are now viewed as the earliest examples of spreadsheets and checklists. Today’s data analysts owe a lot to those brilliant scribes, who helped create a more technical and efficient process.

The process presented as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate is one that will be valuable to you as you keep moving forward in your career:
**Ask:** Business Challenge/Objective/Question
**Prepare:** Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
**Process:** Data cleaning/data integrity
**Analyze:** Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
**Share**: Communicating and interpreting results 
**Act:**  Putting your insights to work to solve the problem

**EMC's data analysis life cycle**
EMC Corporation's data analytics life cycle is cyclical with six steps:

1. Discovery
2. Pre-processing data
3. Model planning
4. Model building
5. Communicate results
6. Operationalize

EMC Corporation is now Dell EMC. This model, created by David Dietrich, reflects the cyclical nature of real-world projects. The phases aren’t static milestones; each step connects and leads to the next, and eventually repeats.

**SAS's iterative life cycle**
An iterative life cycle was created by a company called SAS, a leading data analytics solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results: 

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Explore
4. Model
5. Implement
6. Act
7. Evaluate

The SAS model emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an infinity symbol. Their life cycle has seven steps, many of which we have seen in the other models, like Ask, Prepare, Model, and Act. But this life cycle is also a little different; it includes a step after the act phase designed to help analysts evaluate their solutions and potentially return to the ask phase again. 

**Project-based data analytics life cycle** 
A project-based data analytics life cycle has five simple steps:
1. Identifying the problem
2. Designing data requirements
3. Pre-processing data
4. Performing data analysis
5. Visualizing data

This data analytics project life cycle was developed by Vignesh Prajapati. It doesn’t include the sixth phase, or what we have been referring to as the Act phase. However, it still covers a lot of the same steps as the life cycles we have already described. It begins with identifying the problem, preparing and processing data before analysis, and ends with data visualization.

**Big data analytics life cycle**
Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics life cycle in their book, Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques. Their life cycle suggests phases divided into nine steps:
1. Business case evaluation
2. Data identification
3. Data acquisition and filtering
4. Data extraction
5. Data validation and cleaning
6. Data aggregation and representation
7. Data analysis
8. Data visualization
9. Utilization of analysis results

This life cycle appears to have three or four more steps than the previous life cycle models. But in reality, they have just broken down what we have been referring to as Prepare and Process into smaller steps. It emphasizes the individual tasks required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data before the analysis phase.
